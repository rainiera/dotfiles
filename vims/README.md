### vimrc

Basically just followed instructions from this:

https://github.com/amix/vimrc

where he tells you to install the Awesome version.

```
git clone git://github.com/amix/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
```


Then I `vim ~/.vimrc` and add `set number` at the top to display line numbers.

Pretty awesome because it includes a linter (on `:w`) so you don't have to discover syntax errors at compile time.
